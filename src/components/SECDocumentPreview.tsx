            <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
              The global payments industry is undergoing rapid transformation,
              driven by technological innovation, changing consumer preferences,
              and regulatory developments. According to industry reports, the
              global digital payments market is expected to reach $12.4 trillion
              by 2025, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 23.8% from
              2020 to 2025. Small and medium-sized businesses, which represent a
              significant portion of the economy, often lack access to
              sophisticated payment processing solutions that can help them
              compete effectively in an increasingly digital marketplace.

              Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You
              should carefully consider the risks described below, together with
              all of the other information included in this prospectus, before
              making an investment decision. If any of the following risks
              actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of
              operations, and prospects could be materially and adversely
              affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock
              could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.

            <p className="text-sm font-bold mb-1">We have a history of losses and may not achieve or maintain profitability.</p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
              We have incurred net losses in each year since our inception in 2015.
              We had net losses of <span className="bg-yellow-200 px-1 rounded font-semibold">${netLoss2021}</span>, <span className="bg-yellow-200 px-1 rounded font-semibold">${netLoss2022}</span>, and <span className="bg-yellow-200 px-1 rounded font-semibold">${netLoss2023}</span>
              for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2022, and 2023, respectively.
              We expect to continue to incur significant expenses and operating
              losses for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in our
              business, expand our operations, and develop new products and
              services.

            <p className="text-sm font-bold mb-1">We face intense competition in the payment processing industry.</p>
            <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
              The payment processing industry is highly competitive and
              fragmented. We compete with large, well-established companies such
              as Square, PayPal, Stripe, and others, as well as numerous smaller
              regional and local competitors. Many of our competitors have
              significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing
              resources than we do.

            <p className="mb-4 text-sm">
              Our success depends on our ability to maintain and expand our
              customer base. If we are unable to attract new customers or retain
              existing customers, our revenue growth and profitability would be
              adversely affected. Customer acquisition costs are significant,
              and we may not be able to recover these costs through customer
              relationships.
